How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Eliminated all of the extra clutter to focus on the differences between the
code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Previous versions may have had the better solution all along.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Know exactly what each commit is for and don't have a multitude of commits
to sort through.  It can lead to human error by forgetting to commit at proper
times.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google Docs typically only has changes in files that are independent of one
another, while Git has files that require changes in multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log provides the commits
    git diff provides changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Very.  I have a way to get back to a working state without unneccessary
commenting out.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Machine Learning course
